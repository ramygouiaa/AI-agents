# Agent Project Overview

This project implements intelligent agents using the `phi` library, specifically designed to interact with the GROQ model. The primary focus is on creating agents that can respond to user queries in a meaningful way.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Response Generation**: The agents utilize the GROQ model to generate responses tailored to user inputs.
- **Environment Configuration**: The project leverages environment variables for secure API key management, ensuring that sensitive information is not hard-coded.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to manage common issues, such as missing environment variables.

## Getting Started

To run the agents, ensure that the necessary environment variables are set up in the `.env` file, including the `GROQ_API_KEY`. The agents can be executed directly, providing insightful responses to various queries.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the potential of AI-driven agents in providing interactive and informative experiences. The implementation serves as a foundation for further enhancements and applications in diverse fields.
